            <p>Hello! My name is Michael and I am a web developer. Well, kind of. I will be. But for now, I'm a web
                developer
                in training. But look at this website! Looks nice, huh?! That's because it is nice. You should really
                just hire me now.
                Wouldn't you like your website to look this good? I'm sure your customers would appreciate it. And who
                knows,
                maybe they would spend more time on your website if it looked this good. We all know that the more
                time
                people spend on your website, the more likely they are to purchase your product. So I'll help you
                increase your revenue, and you give me a job. It's a win-win!</p>
                <br>
            <p>This website was created from scratch using only HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading
                Style Sheets).
                There are technologies, like Bootstrap, that make web design much easier accomplish. But I didn't use
                this.
                Heck, I didn't even use Flexbox, which is a CSS module designed to make centering a piece of cake! Yeah,
                I know... Impressive.
                Yet another reason why you should hire me. You'll see that, even if you resize the browser, my content remains
                 viewable. This is because I have incorporated things called "media queries." Media queries are a way of changing
                  the CSS code at specific screen sizes.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>In my portfolio section you'll see that the pictures are just place-holders.
                This is because I haven't completed any projects yet. But they are soon to come! For now, just enjoy
                this formatting masterpiece!
